  "question": "Will a manned, SpaceX vehicle land on Earth's moon before 2030?",
  "resolutionCriteria": "The question will resolve to Yes if a manned vehicle, primarily operated or developed by SpaceX, makes a controlled descent and remains intact upon touching the lunar surface before 2030, otherwise it will resolve to No. A landing is defined as a controlled and intended touch down on the moon's surface where the vehicle remains stationary for at least a brief period, allowing for potential human exit or the vehicle's return. A crash landing, resulting in the destruction or disabling of the vehicle upon impact, shall not count as a successful landing. The vehicle must be crewed by at least one human being from the time of lunar approach to landing. The mission must be designed for human safety and return capability, even if the return is not executed. The vehicle must be designed, manufactured, and operated by SpaceX. Joint ventures are acceptable if SpaceX is the primary operator or holds the majority stake in the mission's operation. The vehicle must carry the SpaceX brand or be officially recognized by SpaceX as part of its fleet or mission set. The landing must occur before midnight (UTC) on December 31, 2029. Official confirmation or verification of the landing must come from SpaceX, a relevant space agency (e.g., NASA), or a reputable third-party observer agreed upon at the market's inception.",
  "background": "Space Exploration Technologies Corp. commonly referred to as SpaceX, is an American spacecraft manufacturer, launch service provider, defense contractor and satellite communications company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. The company was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs and ultimately developing a sustainable colony on Mars. The company currently operates the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets along with the Dragon and Starship spacecraft. Starship is a human-rated, fully-reusable, super heavy-lift launch system for interplanetary and orbital spaceflight. On its first flight in April 2023, it became the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. The rocket reached space on its second flight that took place in November 2023. SpaceX is the first private company to develop a liquid-propellant rocket that has reached orbit; to launch, orbit, and recover a spacecraft; to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; and to send astronauts to the International Space Station. It is also the first organization of any type to achieve a vertical propulsive landing of an orbital rocket booster and the first to reuse such a booster. The company's Falcon 9 rockets have landed and reflown more than 200 times. As of December 2023, SpaceX has around $180 billion valuation.",
